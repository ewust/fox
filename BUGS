Openflow bug (HP Procurve)
---

Does not send flow removed command to correct controller.
If you connect to the Openflow switch over TCP and insert a flow with an
idle timeout, the switch will attempt to connect back to you (if both
passive an active controller types are configured) to send the flow removed
command. If the switch has previously timed out in connecting back in this
manner, it will not send the flow removed command even once it connects.
